# Weather App

A simple and visually appealing weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. It provides details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city entered by the user.
